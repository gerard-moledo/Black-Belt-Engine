# Exercise 2: Sprite Types

There are (right now) 4 different types of sprites you can create.

These types are: players, enemies, projectiles, and text.

To create a sprite with one of those types, like `player`, you would type `Sprite.create("player");`

Don't forget the quotation marks (`""`) around the type!

Now try to create one sprite of each type and click 'Run' to see the result.

Hint: Make sure you create the sprites in the body of the `start()` function, meaning between the `{ }`.
