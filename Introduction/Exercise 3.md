# Exercise 3: Sprite properties

So now we've created different types of sprites, but how do we do things with them, like changing their position or size?

The answer is variables!

## Variables

Variables let us give a name to the sprites we created. Once we have a name, we can use it to change the sprite.

To create a player sprite and store it in a variable named, say, `player`, we type: `player = Sprite.create("player");`

Now that we have a name for the sprite, we can change its properties. For example, its color.

## Color!

To change the color of our `player` object, we first type `player.color` and set it equal to whatever color we want.

So if we want a gold player, type: `player.color = "gold";`. Try it!

Your next task is to change the color of all the objects you created in Exercise 2.

Notice: not all colors will work, only popular colors. If your sprite turns the wrong color, try another!
